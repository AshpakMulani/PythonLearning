# __name__ == __main__
# when we run python script directly or using command line it initializes few variables
# before starting code execution in script. One of such variable is __name__
# and its value is set to __main__  at beginning if script execution. this variable gets initialized
# to __main__ only when script is ran and not when script is imported.
# so we cna use logic if __name__ == __ main__to check if script is ran and not imported and run some code accordingly

# now this script will run main() only when ran directly and not when imported in other script
